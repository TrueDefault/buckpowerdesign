# buckpowerdesign

**Project Statement**
- A customer has requested TI to recommend a power tree for one of their designs that will require multiple rails.
- They would like to see a working PCB with the total TI solution and a simulation test report showing it meets all of their specs.
- The purpose of this project is to learn the basics DC/DC power supply design. Leveraging simulation tools

**Key Project Takeaways**
- Understand the trade-offs between size, efficiency and cost for power supplies
- Learn how to design and simulate power supplies
  – Test/Debug
Understand how each critical component affects it’s corresponding specs
- Additional topics to learn
  – How does the input current loop effect EMI and switch node ringing
  – Trade off between size and heat and layout.
